# Maintenance Log:
- Printer brought to the lab by Ricardo.
- The machine is missing an extruder mount.
- Javier prints a new extruder mount for the Anet-A8.\
    The new extruder mount has the X-axis belt reversed.\
    Mount orientation for the X-axis belt is reversed. This necesitates a change in the firmware X-motor direction.\
    A new belt-tentioner is printed and installed.
- An X-axis rail calibration block (a long rectangular prism) is printed.
- Printer is working. Some test pieces are printed.
- A fan duct is printed and tolerance testing started for friction fit on fan outlet.
- Printer is run with unsecured fan duct, which presumeably falls mid-print and causes a crash.
- Printer is damaged and hotend reading now is stuck at
